# NY_property_sales
Insight in property sales in NY

I wrote this SQL database from the excel file I downloaded from Kaggle.

In this SQL database I narrowed down every zipcode to just one unique address per zipcode to get a rough estimate of NY's area.
Having 1 address per zipcode gave me 246 lines to work with and NULL values included that is explained in my query what extally NULL means in this case.

The following data can be seen as well in my Tableau Public profile.
